## How STEM Connects with Careers - [Dr. Jeremy Price](https://dehsi2022.netlify.app/background/meettheteam/#dr-jeremy-price)

For the proper development of a comprehensive and engaging guidebook, Alex, Kelly, and Ryan are asking for the following information to be inserted into the appropriate folder in Teams.  It would be nearly impossible to provide TOO MUCH information. We can parse through everything you provide to find what we need. 
Unless noted, any format is okay. 

    • Title for the session:
        ◦ Uncovering Community-Embedded STEM Careers
    • 2-4 Sentence summary of the session: 
        ◦ This session explores the realities and possibilities of STEM careers that are embedded in communities. We will map out where we are now and where we want to go with jobs that use STEM and serve communities. We’ll also identify the “chutes and ladders” of getting there.
    • 2-4 Sentence bio for session leaders:
        ◦ Dr. Jeremy Price (he/him/his) is Assistant Professor of Technology, Innovation, and Pedagogy in Urban Education and serves as the Primary Investigator and Project Director for the Digital Education Hub for Rigorous Remote Learning with Communities. Dr. Price also serves as the Primary Investigator and Project Director for the nationwide Community Studies of Antisemitism In Schools (CSAIS) project. As a public scholar-advocate, Dr. Price is invested in using his experiences and expertise to engage and build capacity and capital in educational settings for marginalized and minoritized youth and communities to build, strengthen, and sustain an inclusive and just democratic project. 
    • Any media for the session (pictures, slides, videos, etc.): 
        ◦ Zoom Breakout Rooms
        ◦ Qualtrics set up to capture data input
            ▪ Prompt 1: What are some words that you associate with STEM careers? What do you think of when you think of jobs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics?
                • Word cloud visualization set up
            ▪ Prompt 2: What is your “working definition” of STEM careers?
            ▪ Prompt 3: What are some of your ideas about how careers and STEM can link together?
            ▪ Prompt 4: What are some final reflections about the opportunities and barriers when you think about helping others see different kinds of careers that require STEM?
        ◦ Photos that illustrate a range of careers/jobs in action put into a slide deck.
        ◦ Slides template or Jamboard that is broken into sections for identifying chutes, ladders, and intermediate squares (e.g., https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ttVyOa4WeXPfSHqzKp7gMqqkQOM127qKywXOMwdemxk/)
    • A list of materials for attendees:
        ◦ None
    • A list of questions and activities that attendees will take part in
        ◦ Word Associations with STEM Careers
        ◦ Photo Problem Posing
        ◦ Chutes, Ladders, and Intermediate Squares
If you have questions, please let Ryan, Kelly, or Alex know!

Activities - 
▪ Word Associations with STEM Careers - Participants will collaboratively create a word cloud by contributing words that they associate with STEM careers. They will contribute the words into a Qualtrics survey which can generate a word cloud as a data visualization.
	• Tools: Qualtrics
▪ Photo Problem Posing - Participants as a whole group will be shown different photos of “jobs in process” (maybe 3) in a slideshow and asked the question, "Where are the possibilities for STEM?". We will do a *brief* discussion for each photo, and then each participant will write a description of what they want STEM Careers to look like into Qualtrics.
	• Tools: Google Slides/PPT (for sharing photos) and Qualtrics
▪ Chutes, Ladders, and Intermediate Squares - Participants in small groups will design a “Chutes and Ladders” gameboard going from "where we are" (starting square) to "where we want to be" (ending square). They will identify ladders (opportunities), chutes (barriers), and some of the stages that fall in between. Each group will receive a template slide deck and fill in the appropriate text boxes.
