## What is Third Space? - [Dr. Cristina Santamari Graff](https://dehsi2022.netlify.app/background/meettheteam/#dr-cristina-santamar%C3%ADa-graff)

**Definition of Third Space**
The idea of third space draws from postcolonial sociolinguistics theory and provides conceptual and concrete opportunities to identify interstitial gaps between the prevailing set of STEM epistemologies and discourses and the culturally embedded practices, ways of knowing, and values of marginalized communities and identities (Bhabha, 2012; Brown et al., 2016; Gutierrez et al., 1999). Drawing upon communities’ existing shared and multi-generational mediated tools and artifacts, third space integrates the concept of resistance and dissent by promoting active agency for marginalized identities and communities in their own liberation and opportunities for “oppressed” and “oppressor” to come together and express themselves free from oppressive hegemonic structures (Bhabha, 2012; Gutierrez et al., 1999). Through a postcolonial orientation, third space also integrates co-decolonizing methodologies which are systematic approaches to inquiry and practice whereby those engaged actively resist the dominant hegemony and honor the cultures, legacies, identities, and epistemologies of historically marginalized/colonized groups (Santamaría Graff & Santamaría, 2020). The intentional location of third spaces through community engaged research provides a way to illuminate multiple paths through STEM education pathways that result in communally valued goals and outcomes.

**Activity Structure Outline**
We will use a Venn Diagram activity to conceptualize "2 truths" + third space.
1. Cristina will create 2 different case studies that exemplify two perspectives that are both "true" but seem contradictory.
2. Cristina will demonstrate visually how these truths can be "mapped" to a Venn Diagram with third space being the intersection. This third space is where "improvisation" and "adaptation" take place. It is in this space where dialectal tensions exist and where individuals can unearth and move through these tensions to establish a common understanding that is mutually beneficial for both "sides".
3. Cristina and Ted will facilitate the breakout group sessions where participants will read one case study (there will be two written - one about the Mixteco community and the other about an undergraduate student who is Blind - how both cases demonstrate how third space operates).
4. Participants will be given prompts to apply the case study to third space contexts and, if time remains, to extrapolate upon ways that third space exists within their lived personal and professional experiences.

**Necessary Materials**
Venn Diagram: should this be in a PowerPoint format or other format (I'd like an interactive rather than static platform) Case studies (these need to be written)
Questions/prompts and instructions for participants (these need to be written).
