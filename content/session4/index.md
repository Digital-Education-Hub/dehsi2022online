**Abstract**

This session is titled, “Blooming Through the Mud” which is a metaphor for the way third space provides concrete opportunities to identify interstitial gaps between the prevailing set of STEM epistemologies and discourses and the culturally embedded practices, ways of knowing, and values of marginalized communities and identities (Bhabha, 2012; Brown et al., 2016; Gutierrez et al., 1999). In this session, we explore what it means to identify gaps in perception that oftentimes lead to “conflicting truths” that, if left unaddressed, can be disempowering for community members whose voices and presence have been historically silenced or erased. We conceptualize what it means to “bloom” together when truths appear muddy, unclear, or irreconcilable.  

**Activities**
1. *Blooming Through the Mud: Applying Third Space in Educational Contexts*
	* Participants read two case studies that showcase “2 existing truths”. After reading the case studies, facilitators lead a discussion about one of the case studies using a Vent Diagram. Following this discussion, participants participate in a breakout session where they add to a Vent Diagram and discuss “truths”, “tensions”, and “ways forward” – answering the overarching question: How do we bloom through the mud in seemingly challenging moments?
