**Abstract**

The idea of third space draws from postcolonial sociolinguistics theory and provides conceptual and concrete opportunities to identify interstitial gaps between the prevailing set of STEM epistemologies and discourses and the culturally embedded practices, ways of knowing, and values of marginalized communities and identities (Bhabha, 2012; Brown et al., 2016; Gutierrez et al., 1999). Drawing upon communities’ existing shared and multi-generational mediated tools and artifacts, third space integrates the concept of resistance and dissent by promoting active agency for marginalized identities and communities in their own liberation and opportunities for “oppressed” and “oppressor” to come together and express themselves free from oppressive hegemonic structures (Bhabha, 2012; Gutierrez et al., 1999). Through a postcolonial orientation, third space also integrates co-decolonizing methodologies which are systematic approaches to inquiry and practice whereby those engaged actively resist the dominant hegemony and honor the cultures, legacies, identities, and epistemologies of historically marginalized/colonized groups (Santamaría Graff & Santamaría, 2020). The intentional location of third spaces through community engaged research provides a way to illuminate multiple paths through STEM education pathways that result in communally valued goals and outcomes.

**Activities**

*Blooming Through the Mud: Applying Third Space in Educational Contexts*
* Participants read two case studies that showcase “2 existing truths”. After reading the case studies, facilitators lead a discussion about one of the case studies using a Vent Diagram. Following this discussion, participants participate in a breakout session where they add to a Vent Diagram on Google Slides and discuss “truths”, “tensions”, and “ways forward” – answering the overarching question: How do we bloom through the mud in seemingly challenging moments?
