## Expo/Poster Session - [Akaash Arora](https://dehsi2022.netlify.app/background/meettheteam/#akaash-arora)

For the proper development of a comprehensive and engaging guidebook, Alex, Kelly, and Ryan are asking for the following information to be inserted into the appropriate folder in Teams.  It would be nearly impossible to provide TOO MUCH information. We can parse through everything you provide to find what we need. 
Unless noted, any format is okay. 

    • Title for the session

STEM Expo Session

    • 2-4 Sentence summary of the session

This is what I like to call adult show and tell. During this session there will be 6-8 presenters talking about a program they are apart of that positively impacts the Indianapolis community. Most presenters will present on a program that is related to STEM.

    • 2-4 Sentence bio for session leaders

Akaash Arora – I am a first year PhD student in the Urban Education Studies program. I am a graduate assistant for the Digital Education Hub and this year I have mainly been working with their community caucus. 

    • Any media for the session (pictures, slides, videos, etc.) 

    • A list of materials for attendees

Something to take notes with/jot down ideas
Attendees should come in knowing what presentation sessions they want to attend. They should fill out a survey I will send beforehand.

    • A list of questions and activities that attendees will take part in
Participants will reflect on what they saw during the presentation they go to.

Ideas for connecting Expo to Conjecture Map

    1. Have audience look at all Expo Session titles and descriptions. Which ones are they drawn too? Why? 

    2. When at their Expo Sessions ask audience to connect their work in some way to the presentation.

    3. Ask audience to think deeper about this connection between their work and the presentation. Is a pair up possible? If so, what are they going to do to make this pair up happen? What obstacles could they face along the way?
	
	
	▪ Presentation Reflection Activity - Participants will spend the first part of the Expo session watching two presenters talk about a STEM program they run in Indianapolis. After watching the presentations all participants will come together as a big group and do a reflection activity! Participants will reflect on the presentations they saw and then get an opportunity to share their reflection with the whole group! This will be kind of like a jigsaw, so everyone gets to hear a little bit about all the presentations!
