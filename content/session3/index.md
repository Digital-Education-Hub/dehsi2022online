**Abstract**

This will work like a professional show and tell. During this session there will be six to eight presenters talking about a program they are a part of that positively impacts the Indianapolis community. Most presenters will present on a program that is related to STEM.

**Activities**

*Presentation Reflection Activity*
	* Participants will spend the first part of the Expo session watching two presenters talk about a STEM program they run in Indianapolis. After watching the presentations all participants will come together as a big group and do a reflection activity! Participants will reflect on the presentations they saw and then get an opportunity to share their reflection with the whole group! This will be kind of like a jigsaw, so everyone gets to hear a little bit about all the presentations!
