**Abstract**

The goal of this activity is to design a story quilt that builds and cultivates your identity as a scientist. This includes learning about scientists who come from diverse backgrounds; then you will learn how to make and use sustainable dyes to color fabric for the quilt.

**Activities**

1. **Current Realities:** Historicizing the dialectical relationship between STEM and culture. The concept of repurposing will frame discussions on STEM and Culture. Participants draw a picture or search for a representation of STEM and culture. Participants upload representations to create a science block on a virtual collaborative whiteboard. The science blocks collectively create a Science Quilt.
2. **Future:** Participants go to breakout rooms to brainstorm what are the barriers and opportunities to achieving the examples. They record their answers in Qualtrics.

**Materials**

1. Paper & Drawing Utensil
2. Qualtrics
3. Zoom Breakout Rooms
4. Padlet
