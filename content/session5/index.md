**Double Dutch Story Quilts**

Story Quilt consists of pictures, sound, scents and textures that are used to tell multiple stories. You make a story quilt by hand either on your own or with others to tell a story of a moment, an event, a feeling that is important to you. 

The goal of this activity is to design a story quilt that builds and cultivates your identity as a scientist. This includes learning about scientists who come from diverse backgrounds; then you will learn how to make and using sustainable dyes to color fabric for the quilt.

Quilts encode Indigenous mathematical ideas, social messages, and other sign systems for turning patterns into symbolic meaning. Scholars call these quilt codes “heritage algorithms”. During the underground railroad, African American women recycled hand me down cloths as a means of communication and survival. They designed their quilts to accommodate the scraps and rags which were available to them. The women designers implemented signs and symbols into their quilts with hidden meanings. They used these materials and anything they could get their hands on to piece quilts.

**Culture**

The ways communities enact tools, practices, vernaculars and language. Culture is an expression of identity. Culture reflects the art and politics of communities. 
*Reappropriation* or *repurposing* or the cultural process by which culturally marginalized ethnic groups reclaim artifacts from dominant culture and the environment

**Activity Structure**
*Step 1: What Are Double Dutch Story Quilts?*
{{< figure src="/images/media/session5-media.png" class="align-center">}}
This activity is inspired by Faith Ringgold, an African American artist who was born in 1930 in Harlem, New York City, and is best known for her large, painted story quilts.

*Step 2: Making the Scientist Blocks*
Cut six 4" square patches from paper to create drawings of scientists (see example above). Choose scientists whose backgrounds, or stories are of interest to you.
In addition to the six scientist patches, make an 8" square patch for a drawing of you or someone you know as a scientist (for the center of the quilt). When creating your patches think about:
	* Illustrating (picturing) the story of a scientist
	* Describing the scientists, you chose to draw
	* Describing scientists in general
	* ("You, the Scientist") patch.

*Step 3: Assemble Your Quilt*
Using craft glue and the Science Quilt Template for reference you can adhere the patches to your base sheet of paper or poster board (12" x 16"). 
But before you glue anything down think about the story you are telling; arrange the patches around the center square (You, the Scientist) based on your story. 
Once your science story quilt is assembled you can use a pen or marker to write or draw on it

*Step 4: Necessary Materials*
	* Large paper or poster board (at least 12" x 16")
	* Light-colored or white scrap paper
	* Scissors
	* Craft glue or glue stick (ex. Elmer's)
	* Pencils, pens or markers

**Mediating Process**
*Guiding question:* What does science and reappropriating technologies look like in your communities?

Watch a short video on reappropriating of technologies and community-based practices.
In small groups discuss the science quilts.
Create a shared vision of community-based STEAM and design a new science quilt.

**Outcomes**
Community members will reimage and articulate their perspectives on STEAM.
Community members will provide responses on opportunities and barriers to realizing their collective vision.
