Dear community members, educators, and teachers,

As the Project Director and Primary Investigator, and the Associate Director of the Digital Education Hub of the Indiana University School of Education-Indianapolis at IUPUI, we are excited to welcome you to the first Community Caucus!

The 2022 Summer Institute with the IU Digital Education Hub (DEH) is an annual event convening educators and community stakeholders from across the state of Indiana. This year’s DEH Summer Institute seeks to understand how historically disenfranchised populations of people view STEM’s (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) role in their communities. 

We very excited to see everyone and esteem to create a space for learning and understanding.
