## DAY 1

### 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM | Keynote Speaker: Aster Bekele

This session includes speaker **Aster Bekele**, who will interrogate the institution’s role in highlighting community voice in terms of STEM and thinking of the scientific method as a way to combat systemic issues that historically disenfranchised populations of people face. The speaker will also address how STEM situates in her identity and the work that she contributed to the community.

### 12:30 - 1:00 PM | Derrick Slack

This session continues the conversation started by Aster Bekele. Attendees will use this time to reflect through voices and written reflection guided by the following prompts:

* What assumptions do they have about STEM identities?
* What do they bring to the table?
* Think about STEM identity from the perspective that the keynote provides.

### 1:00 - 1:15 PM | Break

### 1:15 - 2:00 PM | Expo/Poster Session - Akaash Arora & Dr. Ted Hall

Community stakeholders will share what they are doing in the Indianapolis community, exploring active entry points for STEM identities.

### 2:00 - 3:00 PM | What is Third Space? - Dr. Cristina Graff & Dr. Ted Hall

This convened session explores the meaning of third space and why institutions should use them in its interaction with populations of people in the community. The goal of the summer institute is to locate STEM identities in community. The presenters will give voice to stories and create platforms for “other.” Community is the third space and institutions are interrogating on how to welcome and listen to members of the community.
