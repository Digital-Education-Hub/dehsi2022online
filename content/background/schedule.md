## DAY 1

### 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM | Keynote Speaker: Aster Bekele

This session includes speaker **Aster Bekele**, who will interrogate the institution’s role in highlighting community voice in terms of STEM and thinking of the scientific method as a way to combat systemic issues that historically disenfranchised populations of people face. The speaker will also address how STEM situates in her identity and the work that she contributed to the community.

### 12:30 - 1:00 PM | Derrick Slack

This session activity is intended to help prime participants to the concepts and ideas that will be explored during the Summer Institute.  Italso helps form a baseline of the rich ideas that we share and bring to this space.

### 1:00 - 1:15 PM | Break

### 1:15 - 2:00 PM | Expo/Poster Session - Akaash Arora

This will work like a professional show and tell. During this session there will be six to eight presenters talking about a program they are a part of that positively impacts the Indianapolis community. Most presenters will present on a program that is related to STEM. 

### 2:00 - 3:00 PM | What is Third Space? - Dr. Cristina Graff

This convened session explores the meaning of third space and why institutions should use them in its interaction with populations of people in the community. The goal of the summer institute is to locate STEM identities in community. The presenters will give voice to stories and create platforms for “other.” Community is the third space and institutions are interrogating on how to welcome and listen to members of the community. 

## DAY 2

### 11:00 - 11:20 AM | Day Two Introductions - Derrick Slack

A review to gather data and denote how their perceptions have changed from one day to the next day.

### 11:20 AM - 12:05 PM | How STEM connects with Culture - Dr. Ted Hall

The goal of this activity is to design a story quilt that builds and cultivates your identity as a scientist. This includes learning about scientists who come from diverse backgrounds; then you will learn how to make and using sustainable dyes to color fabric for the quilt.

### 12:05 - 12:50 PM | How STEM connects with Careers - Dr. Jeremy Price

This session explores the realities and possibilities of STEM careers that are embedded in communities. We will map out where we are now and where we want to go with jobs that use STEM and serve communities. We’ll also identify the “chutes and ladders” of getting there.

### 12:50 - 1:30 PM | Break

### 1:30 - 2:15 PM | How STEM connects with Classroom - Dr. Craig Willey, Dr. Paula Magee, & Alexandria Fox

In this session, participants will reflect on past & current realities of STEM in the classroom. Following this, we will explore the future possibilities of what STEM could look like in the classroom. 

### 2:15 - 3:00 PM | How STEM connects with Liberation - Idalia Wilmoth & Akaash Arora

For centuries, the arts and sciences have been interwoven. Minoritized populations and disenfranchised communities have made critical contributions to the STEAM field that has shaped our world. However, their path to STEAM education and achievement has been historically limited by systemic racism and oppression. Thus, this session is to understand the power of the arts, and how we can work to make a change in our classrooms, schools, and greater communities to recognize and implement STEAM education.
