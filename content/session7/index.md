**Abstract**

In this session, participants will reflect on past & current realities of STEM in the classroom. Following this, we will explore the future possibilities of what STEM could look like in the classroom.

**Activities**
1. **Current Realities:** Participants draw a picture representing what STEM looked like for them in the classroom or what they imagine it currently looks like. Briefly share with the group what they drew and why. Upload to Qualtrics and write a couple of sentences about it.

2. **Future:** Participants go to breakout rooms to brainstorm what they would like to see change in the classroom around STEM. They record their answers in Jamboard and then everyone comes back together and they share out with the whole group.
